Soln -> 

Given -    array prices
To do -    One day to buy and one day to sold with max profit 
Approach - two things 
              1. BestBuy 
              2. MaxProfit
           so in a loop maxprofit is when prices[i]-bestbuy is maximum from all
           and bestbuy is minimum in the loop
           remembering bestbuy come first and maxprofit after
Solution-  class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
      int bb = prices[0],mp = 0;

      for(int i = 0; i<prices.size() ; i++){
       
            mp = max(mp,prices[i]-bb);
            bb = min( bb, prices[i]);
        
      } return mp; 
    }
};
